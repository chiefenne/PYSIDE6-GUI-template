# GUI Drawing Framework based on the Qt for Python (PySide6) API.

Main classes and functions needed to write a graphical user interface employing the **Qt for Python** API.

The Qt graphics framework always consits of a scene wich contains some graphics items and a view of the scene (i.e. zoom, pan, etc.). There can be more than one scene.
The basic building blocks of such a *Graphics View Framework* are implemented.

It can be used as a starting point for new GUIs which include drawing.

Also dockable windows are implemented to show this add on functionality.
